## Inspriation and About

TEDx is a well established platform for inspiring ideas, and The University of Arizona is home to a progressive community of intellectuals. 

Please continue this tradition at the UofA in promoting big ideas, fostering creativity, and encouraging others. Technology will continue to alter everyone's lives, hopefully it can also improve them. 

Never forget that it takes a great amount of people working very hard to push technology forward towards the future. Those people are us! Congrats and welcome.
